## User Experience Flow

### When User Clicks Restricted Feature:

2. **Immediate Notification**: Toast notification appears: "ðŸš€ Upgrade Required! The [Feature] is available in Gold/Premium plans..."
3. **Page Navigation**: If they navigate to the page directly, they see a beautiful locked feature UI

### Notification Features:
- **Toast Notifications**: Immediate visual feedback
- **Inbox Storage**: Persistent notifications in user's notification inbox
- **Beautiful UI**: Professional locked feature component with gradients and animations
- **Clear Messaging**: Specific feature names and required plan information
- **Easy Upgrade Path**: Direct links to pricing page

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Logger System:
- Uses existing `logAndNotify()` function for consistent notification handling
- Integrates with notification inbox and toast system
- Maintains notification history in database

### Plan Feature Context:
- Leverages existing `PlanFeatureContext` for feature status
- Checks `features["feature_key"]?.enabled` status
- Respects existing feature flags from backend

### Notification Infrastructure:
- Uses existing notification event system (`show-notification-toast`, `refresh-notifications`)
- Integrates with existing `NotificationInbox` component
- Maintains consistency with current notification styling

## Features Configured:

| Feature | Feature Key | Display Name | Required Plans |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Product Inventory | `product_inventory_enabled` | Product Inventory Management | Gold/Premium |
| Expense Tracker | `expense_tracker_enabled` | Expense Tracker | Gold/Premium |
| Dashboard | `dashboard_enabled` | Advanced Dashboard | Gold/Premium |
| WhatsApp Billing | `allow_whatsapp_billing` | WhatsApp Billing | Gold/Premium |

## Technical Implementation:

### Notification Message Format:

```

### Component Structure:
