2. **Feature Previews**: Show limited previews of locked features
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Gradually reveal premium features
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed user behavior tracking

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Tasks:
1. **Monitor Logs**: Check for notification errors or failures
2. **Update Feature Config**: Add new premium features to configuration
3. **Review Analytics**: Track upgrade conversion rates
4. **Test Notifications**: Verify all notification types work correctly

### When Adding New Features:
1. Add feature to `FEATURE_CONFIG` in `featureAccess.js`

- **Subscription counts wrong**: Check status logic in ProfileSubscriptionPage
- **Console errors**: Review logger.js error handling

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check for syntax errors
npm run lint

# Build verification
npm run build

# Development server
npm run dev
```

## Contact and Maintenance
