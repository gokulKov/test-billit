# PWA Installation Guide & Error Resolution

## ✅ Issue Resolution

The original error **"A bad HTTP response code (404) was received when fetching the script"** has been resolved by:

### 1. **Service Worker Configuration**
- ✅ Created development service worker (`/sw-dev.js`)
- ✅ Production service worker auto-generated by next-pwa (`/sw.js`)
- ✅ Smart service worker registration based on environment

### 2. **PWA Handler Improvements**
- ✅ Better error handling for service worker registration
- ✅ Environment-specific service worker paths
- ✅ Graceful degradation when service worker fails

### 3. **Development vs Production Configuration**
- ✅ PWA disabled in development for better performance
- ✅ Full PWA functionality in production builds
- ✅ Development service worker for testing

## 🧪 Testing the PWA Installation

## 🔧 Technical Configuration

### **Service Worker Strategy:**
```javascript
// Development: Simple pass-through
// Production: Network-first with fallback
```

### **Caching Strategy:**
```javascript
{
  urlPattern: /^https?.*/,
  handler: 'NetworkFirst',
  options: {
    cacheName: 'offlineCache',
    expiration: {
      maxEntries: 200,
      maxAgeSeconds: 24 * 60 * 60 // 24 hours
    }
  }
}
```

### **Install Prompt Logic:**
```javascript
- Shows after 3-5 seconds
- Respects user dismissal (7 days)
- Different UX for iOS vs Android
- Detects if already installed
```
