## Integration with Main App

### Layout Detection
The main layout (`src/app/(main)/layout.jsx`) automatically detects mobile devices and renders the mobile layout instead of the desktop sidebar layout.

### Responsive Breakpoint
- Mobile layout: `window.innerWidth < 768px`
- Desktop layout: `window.innerWidth >= 768px`

### State Management
- Integrates with existing PlanFeatureProvider
- Maintains authentication state
- Shares the same API endpoints as desktop version

## Key Mobile Optimizations

### Touch Interactions
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Swipe gestures support
- Touch-friendly form controls

### Performance
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized API calls
- Efficient state management

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface
- Consistent color scheme with desktop
- Appropriate typography scaling
- Icon-based navigation for clarity

## Default Behavior

When users log in on mobile devices:
1. **Default View**: Mobile Record Form (Create tab) - as requested
2. **Navigation**: Bottom tabs for quick switching
3. **Profile**: Accessible through side menu
4. **Settings**: Available in side menu

## Responsive Features

### Sidebar (Desktop)
- Maintains original desktop sidebar for desktop users
- Full navigation with icons and text
- Profile section with advanced features

### Mobile Navigation
- **Side Menu**: Full-featured menu with profile and settings
- **Bottom Tabs**: Quick access to main sections
- **Header**: Current section and basic actions

## File Structure

## Usage

The mobile interface is automatically activated when:
1. User accesses the app on a mobile device (width < 768px)

No additional configuration is required - the system automatically detects and switches to mobile mode.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

## Testing

To test the mobile interface:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Toggle device emulation
3. Select a mobile device or set width < 768px
4. Refresh the page
5. The mobile interface should automatically load

The mobile interface provides a complete, user-friendly experience for managing mobile service records and inventory on mobile devices.
